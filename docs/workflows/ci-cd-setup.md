# CI/CD Workflow Setup Guide

This document outlines the recommended GitHub Actions workflows for Fugatto Audio Lab. Since this is a developing repository, we provide workflow templates that should be implemented as the codebase matures.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Core CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -e ".[dev]"
    
    - name: Run pre-commit hooks
      run: pre-commit run --all-files
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        pytest --cov=fugatto_lab --cov-report=xml
    
    - name: Upload coverage
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        file: ./coverage.xml
```

### 2. Security Scanning (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)

```yaml
name: Security

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Security scanning with Bandit
      run: |
        pip install bandit[toml]
        bandit -r fugatto_lab/ -f json -o bandit-report.json
    
    - name: Dependency vulnerability scan
      run: |
        pip install safety
        safety check --json --output safety-report.json
    
    - name: Upload security reports
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: security-reports
        path: "*-report.json"
```

### 3. Documentation Build (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`)

```yaml
name: Documentation

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: "3.10"
    
    - name: Install docs dependencies
      run: |
        pip install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme
        pip install -e .
    
    - name: Build documentation
      run: |
        cd docs
        sphinx-build -b html . _build/html
    
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: docs/_build/html
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Basic CI (Week 1)
- [ ] Implement core testing workflow
- [ ] Add code quality checks
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting

### Phase 2: Security (Week 2)  
- [ ] Add security scanning workflows
- [ ] Implement dependency monitoring
- [ ] Set up vulnerability alerts

### Phase 3: Documentation (Week 3)
- [ ] Add documentation build workflow
- [ ] Configure GitHub Pages deployment
- [ ] Set up automated API docs

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4+)
- [ ] Container image building
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Release automation

## Configuration Requirements

### Secrets to Configure
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For coverage reporting
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For package publishing (future)
- `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN`: For container publishing (future)

### Branch Protection Rules
```yaml
Required status checks:
  - test (3.10)
  - test (3.11) 
  - test (3.12)
  - security
  - docs

Require branches to be up to date: true
Require pull request reviews: true
Dismiss stale reviews: true
Require review from code owners: true
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Code Quality Gates
- Test coverage must be > 80%
- No high-severity security vulnerabilities
- All linting checks must pass
- Documentation must build successfully

### Performance Benchmarks
- Model loading time < 30 seconds
- Audio generation latency < 5 seconds
- Memory usage < 8GB for standard models

## Next Steps

1. **Create workflows directory**: `mkdir -p .github/workflows`
2. **Implement core CI workflow** using the template above
3. **Configure branch protection** rules in repository settings
4. **Set up monitoring** and notification preferences
5. **Test workflow execution** with a test pull request
