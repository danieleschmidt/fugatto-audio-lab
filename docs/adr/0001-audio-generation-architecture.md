# ADR-0001: Audio Generation Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to define the core architecture for the Fugatto Audio Lab, including model management, audio processing pipelines, and extensibility for different audio generation tasks.

## Decision
We will implement a modular architecture with:
- Core model abstraction layer supporting multiple backends (Fugatto, AudioCraft, custom models)
- Pipeline-based audio processing with composable transforms
- Plugin architecture for custom audio effects and generation methods
- Unified API for text-to-audio, audio-to-audio, and voice cloning workflows

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Extensible framework supporting multiple audio generation models
- Clear separation of concerns between model management and audio processing
- Consistent API across different generation tasks
- Easy integration of new models and techniques

**Negative:**
- Additional abstraction layer may introduce performance overhead
- Increased complexity in initial implementation
- Need to maintain compatibility across different model formats

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Direct Fugatto Integration**: Simpler but limits extensibility to other models
2. **Monolithic Architecture**: Faster initial development but poor maintainability
3. **Microservices**: Better scalability but excessive complexity for current scope

## Implementation Notes
- Core interfaces defined in `fugatto_lab/core.py`
- Model adapters in `fugatto_lab/models/` directory
- Audio processing pipeline in `fugatto_lab/audio/` directory
- Plugin system using entry points for discovery
