## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Fugatto Audio Lab seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Private Disclosure

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please email us at: **security@example.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Severity-dependent (see below)

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Critical | Remote code execution, data breach | 24-48 hours |
| High | Authentication bypass, privilege escalation | 1 week |
| Medium | Information disclosure, DoS | 2 weeks |
| Low | Minor information leaks | 1 month |

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep dependencies updated**: Run `pip install --upgrade fugatto-audio-lab`
- **Use virtual environments**: Isolate your installation
- **Validate audio inputs**: Don't process untrusted audio files
- **Monitor resource usage**: Set limits for generation tasks
- **Secure API keys**: Never commit credentials to version control

### For Contributors

- **Code Review**: All PRs require security review
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated checks for known vulnerabilities
- **Static Analysis**: Bandit security linting enforced
- **Secrets Detection**: Pre-commit hooks prevent credential commits
- **Container Security**: Regular base image updates

## Known Security Considerations

### Audio Processing
- **Memory Usage**: Large audio files can cause OOM
- **File Parsing**: Potential vulnerabilities in audio codecs
- **Model Loading**: Untrusted model files pose execution risks

### ML Model Security
- **Model Poisoning**: Only use trusted pretrained models
- **Adversarial Examples**: Generated audio may contain hidden patterns
- **Data Privacy**: Training data may leak through model outputs

### Web Interface
- **File Uploads**: Restrict file types and sizes
- **CSRF Protection**: Enabled in Gradio/Streamlit interfaces
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent DoS through excessive generation requests

## Security Features

### Current Protections
- Input validation and sanitization
- File type restrictions for uploads
- Memory and compute resource limits
- Secure defaults for model loading
- HTTPS enforcement in production

### Planned Enhancements
- Content-based malware scanning
- Sandboxed model execution
- Audit logging for security events
- Advanced rate limiting
- Secure multi-tenancy support

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Audio data retention policies
- User consent for voice cloning features
- Secure data deletion procedures

### Industry Standards
- Following OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework alignment
- Regular security assessments
- Vulnerability disclosure program

## Security Updates

Security fixes are released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.1 â†’ 0.1.2).

**Update immediately** when security releases are announced via:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Project mailing list
- Discord announcements
- Release notes

## Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not offer a formal bug bounty program, but we recognize security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

- Public acknowledgment (with permission)
- Priority support for security issues
- Early access to new features
- Potential consulting opportunities
