# Fugatto Audio Lab - Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Fugatto Audio Lab  
**Project Manager:** Development Team  
**Start Date:** 2025  
**Expected Duration:** Ongoing  
**Budget:** Open Source Initiative  

## Problem Statement

NVIDIA's Fugatto (Full-spectrum Generative Audio Transformer) represents a breakthrough in controllable audio generation, but lacks accessible tools for:
- Fine-tuning on custom datasets
- Real-time audio generation and preview
- Comprehensive evaluation and quality assessment
- Integration with existing audio production workflows

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Core Platform**: Plug-and-play audio generation toolkit
- **Live UI**: Real-time generation with waveform preview
- **Model Support**: Fugatto, AudioCraft, and custom model integration
- **Training Tools**: Fine-tuning capabilities with loudness-aware loss
- **Evaluation Suite**: Automated metrics and crowd-sourced MOS evaluation
- **Weight Conversion**: Migration tools from EnCodec and AudioCraft models
- **Multi-Modal Generation**: Text-to-audio, audio-to-audio, voice cloning
- **Production Ready**: Docker deployment and performance optimization

### Out of Scope
- Commercial licensing or enterprise support
- Real-time hardware acceleration beyond standard CUDA
- Mobile app development
- Integration with proprietary audio software

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Usability**: Non-technical users can generate audio within 5 minutes of setup
2. **Quality**: Generated audio achieves >4.0 MOS score on standard benchmarks
3. **Performance**: Sub-second inference time for 10-second audio clips on modern GPUs
4. **Adoption**: 1000+ GitHub stars and active community contributions

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Research Impact**: Cited in academic papers and used in research projects
2. **Ecosystem Growth**: 10+ community-contributed models and effects
3. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation with 90%+ coverage
4. **Stability**: <1% error rate in production deployments

- **Quality Consistency**: Maintaining output quality across different prompts
- **Community Adoption**: Building active contributor base

### Low Risk
- **Technical Implementation**: Well-established frameworks and patterns
- **Documentation**: Clear scope and existing examples to follow

## Resource Requirements

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Development**: Modern GPU-enabled development environment
- **Testing**: CI/CD pipeline with GPU runners for model testing
- **Deployment**: Container registry and documentation hosting

### Human Resources
- **Core Development Team**: 2-3 developers with ML/audio experience
- **Community Management**: 1 person for issue triage and community engagement
- **Documentation**: Technical writing support for user guides

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- Minimum 80% test coverage
- Automated linting and formatting
- Type checking with mypy
- Security scanning for dependencies

### Audio Quality
- Automated objective metrics (PESQ, STOI, FAD)
- Subjective evaluation through MOS studies
- A/B testing framework for model comparisons
- Performance benchmarking suite

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
